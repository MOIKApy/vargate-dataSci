# Requirements for Project:
* Must include a README file that states the following:
    * What question are you answering or problem are you analyzing?
    * A brief overview of how you accomplished this, including any necessary background for someone to understand the problem, where your data came from, what you used from that data, any analysis you applied to the data, and what you chose to visualize/display in the final product
    * Any special requirements, dependencies, or steps to run the project


* You must include a SQL database (MySQL or SQLite) where your data will be stored and manipulated
    * You need to include the script that sets up/creates your database


* You must include a Python script used to fetch data from a data source and load it into your SQL database
    * Your data source may be an external API or database, a CSV file, or any other data source that you can read/parse via Python

* You must include a Python script to retrieve the data from your SQL database into a Python object
* You must include a Python script to modify your data so as to prepare it for visualization
    * Some examples of what this script might include:
    * Change data from 2 different datasets/columns into the same format - such as date-times that may have been displayed differently in two columns
    * Combining multiple external data sources into a single database
    * Removing duplicate or unnecessary data
    * There are many other modifications to data that could meet this requirement
* Visualize the results of your analysis using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh or another Python Data Visualization library. Your results cannot be a plaintext representation and you are encouraged to explore a visualization approach that clearly supports a conclusion/result of the analysis of your data.
* Your project is uploaded to GitHub
    * If your project requires your datasource to be included with the project (instead of accessing it from an external source such as through an API), please speak with your mentor about how best to approach this
* Have fun! Your project should be something you're proud of, and that adequately demonstrates your base knowledge in the concepts you've learned.
